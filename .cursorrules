# .cursorrules for Psychiatric Medication Response Predictor

# Existing Code Base
• Build upon existing med_dictionary1803.py for medication name extraction
• Build upon existing snapshot.py for Reddit data collection
• Maintain consistent coding style with existing files
• Add proper docstrings and examples for all new functions and modules

# Project Structure Rules
• Follow the file structure defined in PRD.md
• All Python source code must go in the /src directory
• Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
• Use type hints for all function parameters and return values

# Model Implementation Rules
• Use XGBoost for the GBT model implementation
• Implement multi-task regression for the three response axes
• Always include early stopping with validation data
• Add proper feature importance tracking and SHAP analysis
• Implement confidence-aware training with sample weights
• Include emoji signal integration in feature engineering
• Support both sentence-level and document-level analysis

# Data Management Rules
• Reddit data should be stored in parquet format
• Receptor binding data should be in CSV format with normalized log(Ki) values
• All data loading and merging happens in data_loader.py
• Include proper validation checks for data completeness and quality
• Track confidence scores for all annotations
• Maintain temporal relationship information

# Medication NER Rules
• Leverage the existing med_dictionary1803.py implementation
• Normalize medication names to a standard format
• Extract and standardize dosage information when available
• Handle common misspellings and abbreviations
• Support emoji-based medication mentions
• Track medication status (current/past/brief/prospective)

# Effect Attribution Rules
• Implement dependency parsing for causality detection
• Use pattern matching for direct causal language
• Apply proximity-based attribution for nearby effects
• Consider sentence-level context for accurate linking
• Track confidence scores for each attribution
• Support both explicit and implicit causal relationships
• Handle multiple medications in the same context
• Consider negation and uncertainty markers

# Response Classification Rules
• Implement classifiers for the three clinical axes defined in the PRD
• Use DistilBERT for embedding generation
• Include both keyword-based and embedding-based classification
• Output continuous scores (0-1) for each response dimension
• Support emoji-based emotional signals
• Implement duplicate detection prevention
• Normalize all scores to [0,1] range

# Evaluation Rules
• Compare against all three baselines specified in the PRD
• Include macro-R² calculations across the three axes
• Generate SHAP plots for feature attribution
• Document all findings in the evaluation.md file
• Include confidence-aware evaluation metrics
• Track emoji signal impact on predictions

# Documentation Rules
• Include appropriate disclaimers about the limitations of predictions
• Document all ethical considerations in the README.md
• Maintain comprehensive docstrings for all functions
• Include examples in docstrings
• Document confidence scoring methodology
• Explain emoji signal integration
